## ü§ù Contributing

This platform demonstrates **genuine collaborative intelligence** - agents working together to produce measurably better outcomes than individual capabilities.

### **Agent Development Guidelines**
1. **MCP-Native**: Build directly on MCP tools, no abstraction layers
2. **Real Collaboration**: Agents must improve each other's work measurably  
3. **Quality Focus**: Every feature must demonstrate concrete value
4. **Learning Integration**: Successful patterns stored for platform improvement

### **Testing Philosophy**
- **No mock data**: Test with real addresses and actual satellite imagery
- **Measurable outcomes**: Quality improvements must be quantifiable
- **Cross-agent validation**: Agents test each other's work
- **Real-world scenarios**: Use actual construction project requirements

## üåü The Vision

Building collaborative intelligence so compelling that the interface becomes obvious - because you're showing what actually works, not what looks impressive.

**This isn't just automation - it's intelligence that sees the world, collaborates to solve problems, and continuously improves through interaction.**
